# The Graph CLI (graph-cli)

[![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@graphprotocol/graph-cli.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphprotocol/graph-cli)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graphprotocol/graph-cli.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/graphprotocol/graph-cli)

## The Graph Command Line Interface

As of today, the command line interface supports the following commands:

- `graph init` — Creates a new subgraph project from an example or an existing contract.
- `graph create` — Registers a subgraph name with a Graph Node.
- `graph remove` — Unregisters a subgraph name with a Graph Node.
- `graph codegen` — Generates AssemblyScript types for smart contract ABIs and the subgraph schema.
- `graph build` — Compiles a subgraph to WebAssembly.
- `graph deploy` — Deploys a subgraph to a
  [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node).
- `graph auth` — Stores a [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) access token in
  the system's keychain.
- `graph local` — Runs tests against a [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node)
  test environment (using Ganache by default).
- `graph test` — Downloads and runs the [Matchstick](https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick) rust
  binary in order to test a subgraph.
- `graph add` - Adds a new datasource to the yaml file and writes the necessary changes to other
  files - schema.graphql, abi and mapping.

## How It Works

The Graph CLI takes a subgraph manifest (defaults to `subgraph.yaml`) with references to:

- A GraphQL schema,
- Smart contract ABIs, and
- Mappings written in AssemblyScript.

It compiles the mappings to WebAssembly, builds a ready-to-use version of the subgraph saved to IPFS
or a local directory for debugging, and deploys the subgraph to a
[Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node).

## Installation

The Graph CLI can be installed with `npm` or `yarn`:

```sh
# NPM
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli

# Yarn
yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

### On Linux

`libsecret` is used for storing access tokens, so you may need to install it before getting started.
Use one of the following commands depending on your distribution:

- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev`
- Red Hat: `sudo yum install libsecret-devel`
- Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S libsecret`

## Getting Started

The Graph CLI can be used with a local or self-hosted
[Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) or with the
[Hosted Service](https://thegraph.com/explorer/). To help you get going, there are
[quick start guides](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developer/quick-start/) available for both.

If you are ready to dive into the details of building a subgraph from scratch, there is a
[detailed walkthrough](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developer/create-subgraph-hosted/) for that as
well, along with API documentation for the
[AssemblyScript API](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developer/assemblyscript-api/).

## Release process

We use `changeset` to manage releases. Every PR should include a changeset file. The release process
is as follows:

1. Author creates the PR with changes and runs `pnpm changeset` to create a changeset file to
   summarize the changes.
2. When the PR is merged to `main`, a Github Action will run and create a PR with the version bump
   and changelog.
3. We will merge the bot generated PR to `main`.
4. A Github Action will run and publish the new version to npm.

- [Snapshot release](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/snapshot-releases.md)

### Stable release example

When PRs are merged and to `main` we can choose to merge the bot generated changeset PR to `main`
and it will publish a new version to npm.

Example of a `graph-client` release: https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-client/pull/295

### Alpha release example

Every PR to `main` that includes a changeset file will create a new alpha version.
