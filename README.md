# The Graph CLI (graph-cli)

[![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@graphprotocol/graph-cli.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphprotocol/graph-cli)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graphprotocol/graph-cli.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/graphprotocol/graph-cli)

## The Graph Command Line Interface

As of today, the command line interface supports the following commands:

- `graph init` — Creates a new subgraph project from an example or an existing contract.
- `graph create` — Registers a subgraph name with a Graph Node.
- `graph remove` — Unregisters a subgraph name with a Graph Node.
- `graph codegen` — Generates AssemblyScript types for smart contract ABIs and the subgraph schema.
- `graph build` — Compiles a subgraph to WebAssembly.
- `graph deploy` — Deploys a subgraph to a [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node).
- `graph auth` — Stores a [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) access token in the system's keychain.
- `graph local` — Runs tests against a [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) test environment (using Ganache by default).
- `graph test` — Downloads and runs the [Matchstick](https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick) rust binary in order to test a subgraph.
- `graph add` - Adds a new datasource to the yaml file and writes the necessary changes to other files - schema.graphql, abi and mapping.

## How It Works

The Graph CLI takes a subgraph manifest (defaults to `subgraph.yaml`) with references to:

- A GraphQL schema,
- Smart contract ABIs, and
- Mappings written in AssemblyScript.

It compiles the mappings to WebAssembly, builds a ready-to-use version of the subgraph saved to IPFS or a local directory for debugging, and deploys the subgraph to a [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node).

## Installation

The Graph CLI can be installed with `npm` or `yarn`:

```sh
# NPM
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli

# Yarn
yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

### On Linux

`libsecret` is used for storing access tokens, so you may need to install it before getting started. Use one of the following commands depending on your distribution:

- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev`
- Red Hat: `sudo yum install libsecret-devel`
- Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S libsecret`

## Getting Started

The Graph CLI can be used with a local or self-hosted [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) or with the [Hosted Service](https://thegraph.com/explorer/). To help you get going, there are [quick start guides](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developer/quick-start/) available for both.

If you are ready to dive into the details of building a subgraph from scratch, there is a [detailed walkthrough](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developer/create-subgraph-hosted/) for that as well, along with API documentation for the [AssemblyScript API](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developer/assemblyscript-api/).

## Release process

The steps to create a new version of the `graph-cli` are:

1. Decide which version number you'll be rolling out. You can check the differences between the current `main` branch and the latest release.
2. Create a PR with the commit generated by `npm version <VERSION> [<PREID>]`.
3. Once that's approved and merged to `main`, you can publish it to `npm` and push the git tags as well.
4. Last but not least, create a Github Release refering to the pushed git tag, linking to the PRs involved.

### Stable release example

Current version: `0.34.9`.
Desired release: `0.35.0`.

To create the PR:
```
git checkout -b <BRANCH>

npm version minor

git push --set-upstream <REMOTE> <BRANCH>
```

Once that's approved and merged, you can update your local `main` and:

```
npm publish

npm push --tags
```

### Alpha release example

Current version: `0.29.2`.
Desired release: `0.30.0-alpha.0`.

To create the PR:
```
git checkout -b <BRANCH>

npm version preminor --preid alpha

git push --set-upstream <REMOTE> <BRANCH>
```

Once that's approved and merged, you can update your local `main` and:

```
npm publish --tag alpha

npm push --tags
```

### Alpha pre-release example

Current version: `0.30.0-alpha.0`.
Desired release: `0.30.0-alpha.1`.

To create the PR:
```
git checkout -b <BRANCH>

npm version prerelease --preid alpha

git push --set-upstream <REMOTE> <BRANCH>
```

Once that's approved and merged, you can update your local `main` and:

```
npm publish --tag alpha

npm push --tags
```
