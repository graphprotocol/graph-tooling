# Osmosis Token Swaps Example

This example subgraph stores `TokenSwap` objects that represents token swaps made using the [GAMM](https://docs.osmosis.zone/developing/osmosis-core/modules/spec-gamm.html) (Generalized Automated Market Maker) in the Osmosis chain. In order to do that, an event handler is used to filter [token_swapped](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/c8ac95c6a6ea42e934d49599eafc8609b3c6fe61/x/gamm/types/events.go#L13) events. The type of event to be filtered is specified in the subgraph manifest file. That way, the handler will just receive events of that type.

By running this example subgraph, and with the following query, you can retrieve all the swaps made by a given address:

```
query SwapsForAccount($senderAddress: String!) {
  tokenSwaps(where: {sender: $senderAddress}) {
    tokenIn {
      amount
      denom
    },
    tokenOut {
      amount
      denom
    }
  }
}
```
```
{
  "senderAddress": "osmo1wd3j7cvcnr3pfey4fx2mz9xml9euu68z6zg0xp"
}
```
